\section{Overall System Design}

\subsection{Short description of the main parts of the system}
\begin{itemize}
\item Home
This system will display the buttons required to  access the rest of the program and exit the program
\item Match
This system will display the details of a all the past matches that have been entered into the system. 
\item Player 
This system  will display all the details that have been entered by the user on an individual player.

\section{User Interface Designs}

\section{Hardware Specification}
The system will need to run on a desktop computer, a laptop and on a tablet. It will need to run on the computers at 1360x768, in a 16:9 aspect ratio screen as well the IPad's 1024x768-pixel display, in a 4:3 aspect ratio. A keyboard will be needed for input as well as a pointer device to navigate around the system. A display will be used for the output of the program. The data for the program will be held on a hard drive.
